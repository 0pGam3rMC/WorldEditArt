============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

## Supported API Versions
WorldEditArt explicitly does not support running on unofficial builds of PocketMine. WorldEditArt can only be used on
PocketMine servers with API 3.0.0-ALPHA7 onward.

## User Guide (for both admins and builders)
This user guide is intended for builders using WorldEditArt.

> `ADMIN` Paragraphs starting with `ADMIN` contain non-builder information (e.g. permissions, config). You may ignore
these paragraphs if you are only a builder, not a server owner/admin.

> `PROTIP` Paragraphs starting with `PROTIP` explain why some features would be useful and provide suggestions/tips on
using them. If you are only looking for reference and don't want any suggestions here, skip these paragraphs.

### Start using WorldEditArt
> `ADMIN` A config file will be generated upon the plugin's first run. You may restart the server after editing the
config file to apply the changes.

Type the command `//status` to see basic information about the server setup. It should show you the WorldEditArt version
as well as your current session information (if you have permission to start a session). If the server has enabled
implicit builder sessions, you should have already started a builder session automatically. Otherwise, you have to run
the `//session start` command to start a builder session explicitly. Some servers may require an extra passphrase to
unlock a builder session; in that case, run `//session start <password>`, where `<password>` is the passphrase.

> `ADMIN` To start builder sessions automatically, set `implicit builder session` to `true` in config.yml. If it is set
> to `false`, builder sessions have to be started by typing commands ("explicit builder sessions").

> `PROTIP` Explicit builder sessions can protect the server by preventing builders from accidentally executing world-
> editing operations. The session can also be closed with `//session close`.

> `ADMIN` If `implicit builder session` is set to `false`, you may setup a global passphrase for starting builder
> sessions. To disable this passphrase, leave it empty (`""`).

> `PROTIP` Passphrases can provide an extra safety layer &mdash; even if someone else managed to login as a builder
> (e.g. ~~his brother~~ ~~his cat~~ [the spider in his house](https://xkcd.com/1530) is using his phone), if they don't
> get this passphrase, they still can't destroy your server using WorldEditArt.

### Bookmarks
Bookmarks allow you to save locations in different worlds using names. You can use them in some commands to easily
specify locations without actually going there, e.g. using them with `//at`.

Editing bookmarks is very simple. Use `//bm add <name>` to add a bookmark named `<name>` (at your current location); use
`//bm remove <name>` to delete a bookmark named `<name>`.

You may also use `//bm` to list all bookmarks. Use `//bm tp <name>` to teleport to the bookmark named `<name>`.

Note that bookmarks will also save your rotation.

> `PROTIP` Use `//bm add` along with `//at` to save bookmarks at specified coordinates, e.g. `//at 1 2 3 bm add my_new_bookmark`.

### Executing commands at mocked locations
Many WorldEditArt commands depend on your current location, but it may be annoying to fly/teleport around all the time.
WorldEditArt lets you execute commands as if you are at another location using the `//at` command.

> **IMPORTANT:** `//at` only works with **WorldEditArt builder commands**, i.e. commands that require you to start a builder session to
use.

There are four types of location mocking:

#### by specifying coordinates
```
//at 1 ~2 ~-3 <command> [args ...]
```

The above command will execute `//<command> [args ...]` at the position where x-coordinate is 1, y-coordinate is your
current y-coordinate plus 2 and z-coordinate is your current z-coordinate minus 3. Your rotation will not be mocked.

You may or may not add slashes in front of `<command>` when you type it; WorldEditArt will fix it automatically (since
all WorldEditArt commands start with `//`).

The [tilde notation](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Commands#Tilde_notation) is supported for the coordinates.

#### by world spawn
```
//at s <world> <command> [args ...]
```

The above command will execute `//<command> [args ...]` at the world spawn of `<world>`. Your rotation will not be mocked.

You may or may not add slashes in front of `<command>` when you type it; WorldEditArt will fix it automatically (since
all WorldEditArt commands start with `//`).

Note that `<world>` is the folder name of the world, not the saved world name. If you don't understand what's the
difference, have a look at `/status` (the PocketMine one enabled with `debug.commands` in pocketmine.yml, not `//status`
from WorldEditArt) &mdash; use the one in `""`, not the one in `()` (if any).

#### by bookmark
```
//at bm <bookmark name> <command> [args ...]
```

The above command will execute `//<command> [args ...]` at the location of bookmark `<bookmark name>`. Your rotation
**will** be mocked as the bookmark's rotation.

You may or may not add slashes in front of `<command>` when you type it; WorldEditArt will fix it automatically (since
all WorldEditArt commands start with `//`).

#### by warp
If the server has [SimpleWarp](https://github.com/Falkirks/SimpleWarp) enabled, warps can also be used.

```
//at s <world> <command> [args ...]
```

This command is similar to bookmarks, except that the rotation will **not** be mocked.

### Construction zones
> `ADMIN` Construction zones are disabled by default. Set `construction zone check` in config.yml to `true` to enable.

If the server enables construction zones, builders cannot use WorldEditArt to change blocks outside construction zones.

> `ADMIN` Servers may mark whole worlds as construction zones by adding a world name below `construction zone worlds` in
config.yml.

> `ADMIN` Builders with the `worldeditart.admin.czone.bypass` permission can build outside construction zones.

Builders can check the information of the construction zone they are in using the `/cz check` command.

To gain exclusive access to this construction zone, the builder can use the `/cz lock <name>` command, which stops other
builders from doing WorldEditArt world-editing in this construction zone.

Adding the `blocks` argument (i.e. `/cz lock <name> blocks`) will additionally block players from breaking/placing
blocks in the construction zone (but does not affect block updates like water flowing, TNT, etc.), while adding the `entry` argument (i.e. `/cz lock <name> entry`) will additionally block entry,
block breaking/placement and world editing. They can later be unlocked with the `/cz unlock <name>` command, but they
are automatically unlocked when the builder session is closed (when the player quits, when the session is explicitly
closed, when the server restarts, etc.).

> `PROTIP` World-editing operations may cause industrial accidents such as trapping players inside a wall, overlapping
> other builders' constructions, etc.
