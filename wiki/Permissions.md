Permissions
===========

Permissions in WorldEditArt are mainly classified into "builder permissions" and "admin permissions". "Builder" refers
to the player who actually wants to change blocks in the world, while "admin" is the player who supervises builders and
decides what should be built, where things should be built, etc. Builder permissions are under the permission node
`worldeditart.builder`, while admin permissions are under the permission node `worldeditart.admin`.
